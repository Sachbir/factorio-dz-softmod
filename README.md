# Factorio Soft Mod - DDDGamer

This is a Factorio softmod entirely made by DDDGamer. I am merely learning form his code, and tweaking it somewhat to suit my needs. 
I'm new to GitHub, so please let me know if I've messed up on the etiquette. 



----------



# What is a soft mod?
A modification to the `control.lua` file.

## control.lua
* Factorio folder location: Factorio/data/base/scenarios/freeplay/
* Purpose: Sets up the initial game and is downloaded onto all the clients automatically in multiplayer. The original vanilla file tells the game to give you items at the start of the game and gives you pistol + ammo upon respawn

# How to install?

## For multiplayer server / add to existing save game
* Create a new map (if you haven't already you can apply to existing maps)
* Browse to the save file (.zip archive file) for your server
  * Local saves are in C:/Users/*[yourusername]*/AppData/Roaming/Factorio/saves/
* Open the zip (typically `_autosave1.zip`)
* Replace the original `control.lua` with the one in this repo

## For development
* Browse to Factorio freeplay scenarios folder Factorio/data/base/scenarios/freeplay/
* Backup the original `control.lua`
* Replace the original `control.lua` with the one in this repo
* If you make a new game, the soft-mod will be applied
